In this project, we develop a content-based recommender system for games in [Board Game Arena (BGA)](https://boardgamearena.com/). 
We collect information of the BGA's games using the API of [Board Game Geek (BGG)](https://boardgamegeek.com/). 
We explore the data, we build the recommender and we develop a web application to try it. 
The details of the process can be found in the following folders:

- [1.Data_Collection](https://github.com/mgiaroli/BGA_games_recommender/tree/main/1.Data_Collection)
- [2.Data_Exploration](https://github.com/mgiaroli/BGA_games_recommender/tree/main/2.Data_Exploration)
- [3.Recommender](https://github.com/mgiaroli/BGA_games_recommender/tree/main/3.Recommender)

You can try the streamlit web application follow this link: [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/mgiaroli/bga_games_recommender/main/3.Recommender/streamlit_app.py)

Future approach: develop a collaborative filtering recommender system.
